An **Expandable Minion Cube Cluster** is a modular supercomputer squad of **Raspberry Pi 3** single-board computers, sometimes called a "bramble".  The intent would be to extend additional **E=MC<sup>2</sup>**'s by adding more and ganging them together via an external Ethernet switch.

This open-source project includes the hardware specifications, price list, software and eventually, the 3D printing files for the container to hold the project in its entirety.

### Parts
The minimum list of hardware for the project is in the **HARDWARE.md** file itself.  Note that during the setup period you may also find it useful to have the following:

* USB-based keyboard
* USB-based mouse
* HDMI-to-DVI cable
* Monitor which accepts DVI input
* Standard 5V Raspberry Pi power adapter
* USB-based adapter which accepts either a micro-SD or an SD card, noting that each micro-SD purchased comes with an SD adapter

### Software
The github repository will hold the differences required for each computer so that the entire system can work together.  Each computer is based upon the Raspbian operating system.  The [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md) software will make the installation of Raspian easier but in this case, it needs to be initially installed on each micro-SD adapter.

You may find it simpler to purchase the pre-installed NOOBS micro-SD cards directly, saving a step per computer during the setup.

### Computer Names
Here is a partial list of the first four computers in your system.  The first listed below is considered to be the **villian** (normally referred to as the "master") and the remainder are the **minions** (normally referred to as the "slaves").

1. gru
2. dave
3. kevin
4. bob

### Instructions

Coming soon... since I'm working on this project in real-time.
